# Customer Segmentation, Targeting, and Positioning Analysis

## Overview

In the realm of marketing, customer segmentation serves as a strategy for optimizing product offerings and aligning marketing efforts with diverse customer needs. This project using the Customer Personality Analysis dataset, featuring demographic details, purchasing behaviors, and interactions with marketing campaigns, to delineate customer segments clearly. Through data preprocessing, feature selection, clustering, and various analytical techniques, this empirical study aims to enhance targeting and positioning strategies, thereby fostering improved business decision-making and customer satisfaction.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

The dataset initially contained 2,240 entries across 26 features. Cleaning involved removing rows with missing values, particularly in the 'Income' column, and addressing outliers in 'Education' and 'Marital Status'. Features such as 'Year_Birth' and 'Income' required normalization due to their skew. Outliers were removed to prevent them from skewing the analysis, especially those in birth years before 1940 and incomes exceeding $150,000. After preprocessing, categorical variables were encoded, and the entire dataset was standardized.

## Feature Selection

Feature selection aimed to identify variables most indicative of distinct customer behaviors and preferences. Analysis revealed that 'Income', 'MntWines', and 'NumCatalogPurchases' were particularly telling, suggesting significant spending patterns and engagement levels. The model incorporated these insights, focusing on six key features to optimize clustering accuracy and interpretability.

## Dimensionality Reduction

Techniques such as PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP were employed to manage the high-dimensionality of the dataset effectively. PCA helped in reducing the dataset to its most informative axes, capturing substantial variance within fewer dimensions. t-SNE and UMAP provided nuanced insights into the local and global data structures, aiding in the detailed visualization of customer segments.

## Clustering Techniques

K-means clustering was applied, with the optimal number of clusters determined by silhouette scores. This method facilitated the identification of distinct groups within the customer base, each characterized by unique purchasing behaviors and demographic features. The clustering not only segmented the customer base effectively but also highlighted potential strategies for targeted marketing.

## Empirical Results and Cluster Description

Each cluster was analyzed to deduce characteristic patterns and preferences. For instance, one cluster might include high-income, frequent purchasers of premium products, while another might consist of more price-sensitive customers with distinct buying habits. These insights are crucial for developing tailored marketing strategies that resonate with each segment's unique preferences and needs.

## Conclusion

The project underscores the importance of customer segmentation in crafting effective marketing strategies. By using analytical techniques, it was possible to uncover meaningful patterns and segments within a diverse customer base. These findings can facilitate targeted marketing initiatives, optimized resource allocation, and enhanced customer engagement, thus driving business growth and customer satisfaction.
